## October 2019, EdLUG, Tai Kedzierski

What I did

* I copied the text of various sections into a word processor (you can use MS Word or [LibreOffice][libreoffice] for this), and printed the pages out
    * landscape, two columns, column breaks after each section for 6 actual sheets, one-sided. Adapt for your own, YMMV
    * I printed three copies for reference, but indicated that participants should follow along online where possible.
* I started the session checking that everybody had a Github account and installed Git (Windows users mainly)
    * I asked participants to do this ahead of the session on the Meetup page
* I then ran through the sections prior to the handds-on part fairly quickly, deliberately
    * I asked at each step who already knew it, like "who already knows git" and "who already knows github" and "who has already tried using git with github"
        * I frequently indicated that the hands-on portion would consolidate what was quickly covered
    * I ran through faster when evreybody knew, and expanded more in detail when not everybody said they knew
    * For the list of commands, I emphasised that all of them would be used and experienced in the hands-on session
        * The list is for reference
* We then ran the workshop
    * I had two people present as assistants who also knew git professionally to help answer questions
    * Participants did ask questions about use cases of commands, best practices, and more, and myself and assistants were able to explain
* I hightlited after the session what contributions are also valid beyond code as closing notes on the session

Things I would do differently next time

* The original version of the hands-on introduces people to Merge Conflicts.
    * This was to highlight the possibility, and offer people the time to experience them and ask questions around resolving them.
        * Most people had already tried to dabble on their own with git, so this was likely appropriate
    * If the crowd had been much more novice, this could have consumed a lot of time, so the new hands-on indicates both options
        * Adding individual files for each participant removes the need to have merge conflict resolution
* I occasionally slipped up and asked "does anybody _not_ know X"
    * This could leave shyer people behind, who are afraid to raise their hands. Always ask who knows, and you'll see who doesn't.
* I was told I could use a system of green/red post-its in the next session - and I will!
    * Give each person a green and a red post it at the start of the session, which they can stick on their laptop screens as needed
    * If green they have completed whatever section you instructed them to go to
    * If red, they can discretely indicate that they need help
    * Could also be "blue/pink", "purple/orange" etc - a cool and a warm colour in general
* I should have actually booked tables at the venue. We were a little cramped initially until neighbouring tables freed up. Oops.
    * It was a little more popular than I expected. 10 attendees confirmed on Meetup, and 10 people actually turned up (normally I expect 50% attendance...)
* There were a couple of bugs in the demo script when running on Mac and Windows, these should now be fixed
    * I developed the script on Ubuntu. If you can, check that it works on other Linux, Windows Git Bash, Mac, and BSD.
* I need to work on a way to introduce branches in a succinct manner
